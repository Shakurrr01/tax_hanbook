  // Foreword
  foreword: {
    title: "Foreword by the Commissioner General",
    commissionerGeneral: "Commissioner General",
    commissionerName: "NIWENSHUTI Ronald",
    commissionerTitle: "Commissioner General",
    paragraph1: "It gives me great pleasure to present to you the 2nd printed edition of the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) Tax Handbook. This Tax Handbook is a very important demonstration of RRA's strong commitment to be 'Here For You, To Serve'. This means that at RRA we are striving to provide the best possible service to you, our taxpayers.",
    paragraph2: "This Tax Handbook attempts to answer any questions that taxpayers might have about how, when, where, which taxes, what amount and even why they pay taxes. In this printed edition, we include an update on the new tax laws concerning Income, Value Added Tax, sources of revenue and property of decentralized entities, excise duty, automatic exchange of information for tax purposes, and tax procedures.",
    paragraph3: "This covers all aspects of domestic taxes, local government taxes and fees, and customs duties. This means that all of Rwanda's tax laws, processes and procedures are summarised in one place for the benefit of all taxpayers.",
    paragraph4: "Another important aim of this Handbook is to show taxpayers the ease with which they can declare and pay taxes online or on their mobile phones. Simple step-by-step guides illustrate how to declare taxes using E-Tax, M-Declaration and the Local Government Taxes (LGT) system. After declaring, taxes can then easily be paid using systems such as E-Payment, Online Banking, MTN Mobile Money and Mobicash. All of these systems mean that it has never been easier, and never taken less time, to comply with your tax obligations.",
    paragraph5: "In addition, the sections on general RRA information are very important to show taxpayers the processes by which RRA monitors tax compliance, negotiates payment of unpaid due taxes, allows for fair hearings and penalises non-compliance. Finally, the ultimate aim of this Tax Handbook is to help taxpayers. We want taxpayers to understand fully their tax obligations. We want taxpayers to know that RRA is working for them. We want taxpayers to tell their friends, suppliers, customers and competitors that paying their taxes has never been easier and has never been more important in financing the development of our country."
