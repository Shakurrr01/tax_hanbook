                        Depreciation reflects the reduction of the value of an asset over time, in particular because of wear and tear.
                    </p>
                    <p className="content-paragraph">
                        Assets purchased with the value below FRW 500,000 are considered as expenses and cannot be depreciated. Depreciation of all other business assets can be deducted in Real Regime on the basis described below.

                    <p className="content-paragraph">
                        The cost of purchasing, constructing and improving buildings, equipment and heavy machinery that is fixed in walls depreciates by 5% annually of the cost price.

                    <p className="content-paragraph">
                        The cost of purchasing, constructing and improving intangible assets that have been purchased from a third party depreciates by 10% annually of the cost price.

                    <p className="content-paragraph">
                        The assets in the following two categories are depreciated in a pooling system on the basis of the following rates:

                        <li>Computers and accessories, information and communication systems, software products and data equipment depreciate at the rate of 50%.</li>

                    <p className="content-paragraph">
                        The pooling system means that all similar items of these categories can be aggregated and the cost depreciated as single items.

                        If a taxpayer's taxable income (as calculated on page 2) is less than zero, this is referred to as a net loss. If a taxpayer declares a net loss in an Income Tax declaration, this loss may be carried forward and deducted from the Income Tax declarations of the next five tax periods, with earlier losses being deducted before later losses.
                    </p>

                        However, a taxpayer who applies to the tax administration may be allowed to carry forward the loss for more than five (5) tax periods but without exceedingly further five (5) tax periods, if he or she fulfils the requirements that are provided for by ministerial order.
